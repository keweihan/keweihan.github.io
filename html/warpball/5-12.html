           <br>
           <pre>
- Now using Cinemachine instead of custom camera script to follow player movement
- Added basic collectible and ramp prefabs
- Added boost system where player increases speed upon passing through ramp and collecting collectible
- Added camera shake on boosting and landing

            The bit of work done since the last log involves implementing more camera effects to make gameplay feel more dynamic.
           </p>
           
           <p>
                I discovered Cinemachine (a Unity package) and using that over a custom script gives 
                a lot more customizability and also allows vertical camera damping, among many other 
                customizable traits. It's overall a much better camera controller than I could ever 
                write in a reasonable amount of time and fits the purpose very well too.
           </p>
            
            
            <p>
                Another change was adding a boost function that increases player speed. This function 
                would be invoked on collecting collectibles and passing through gates,
                same as in Warp Rush (the inspiration source). This also provides the opportunity for 
                more camera movement. Specifically, increase in FOV based on player 
                speed and camera shake on boosting. 
            </p>
            

            <p>
                I initially tried to implement camera shake as part of a camera controller script alongside 
                the previous custom camera controller (i.e. not Cinemachine), but it turns out it's not at all
                straightforward to write a decent camera shake script for a camera that's constantly moving and 
                subject to SmoothDamp lerping functions. Cinemachine was the solution as it comes with the ability
                to do good camera shake on top of being a generally great and simple camera package. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I also made temporary basic collectible and ramp prefabs so I can see the product of adding
                these camera effects. 
            </p>

            <p>
                There's still a few things that can be done - such as using camera noise in Cinemachine, having 
                different intensity camera shakes depending on time spent off the floor, making the FOV changes
                more noticeable while capping it etc., but for now I'm happy with the way it is and want to move
                to simple environment generation to make this endless so it can start to have some traits of an actual game.
