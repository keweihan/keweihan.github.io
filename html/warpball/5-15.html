           Changes: 
           <br>
           <pre>
- Added basic framework for generating ramps, collectibles and obstacles during runtime. 
    - Generate objects zone by zone as player moves forward 
      (where "zone" coordinates are defined by user)
    - Customizable number of objects per zone
    - Customizable minimum distance between generated objects 
      (to prevent clipping and customize spacing)
    - Specify zone to generate objects by changing dimensions of gameObject 
      (which is visualized) as opposed to using public variables
           </pre>
           
           <p>
            Wrote a very basic environment generation script that allows an 
            unending plane of ramps, collectibles, obstacles, or whatever prefab the designer chooses.
            Currently you can see objects popping into existence, but this can be masked by changing 
            camera render distance and/or adding post-processing fog.
            </p>

            <p>
                Boring details below:
            </p>
            <p>
                This uses a generation "zone", which is visualized by the 
                green rectangle in the picture below. (Note white is camera field of vision)
            </p>
            
            <img src="files/warpball/5-15/gen-zone.png" alt="Generation Zone screenshot">

            <p> 
                This zone will always remain in the same position relative to the player. Once the zone reaches a completely
                empty area (when the beginning of the zone passes the end of the previous zone), the script will 
                run functions "GenerateObjects()". 
            </p>

            <p>
                GenerateObjects() will, for each to-be-generated object, do the following:
                <div style="width: 80%; margin: auto; font-size: 12;">

                
                    <p>
                        - Use Mathf.rand to generate a position within the boundaries of the zone to place the new object. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        - Check that the randomly generated position inside the zone is far enough away from every other generated object using
                        a temporary list of positions
                    </p>
                    

                    <p>
                        - If position is valid this position to a temporary list of positions of objects generated within the zone. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        - If it is not valid the function will rerun Mathf.run until a valid position is found OR a maximum number of tries has been reached.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This way there will be no clipping of objects and the designer can specify how spaced out they want objects to be.
            </p>

            <p>
                I also thought it was pretty neat idea to, instead of using public variables to specify boundaries of the zone, using 
                a 3D rectangle with rendering and collisions turned off as a visualizer of the zone, and using script to convert it
                to a boundary in numbers. Should make it much easier to make changes and tweaks in the future.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the future this system can be improved by adding rounding positions to 5s or 10s so there's more order to generation,
                but for now I want to move on to making some skeleton UI and game mechanics and a game manager.
            </p>

            <p>
                Also made a version of the project to use HDRP instead of URP for rendering to see some cool reflections. Not sure which one
                to use yet since I'm not sure if such a simple game warrants high quailty rendering systems.
            </p>
