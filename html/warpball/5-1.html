            Basic prototype of the game. Temporary ramps were placed manually for testing.
            
            Strafe movement of the ball (player) is currently controlled
            directly by player input and uses direct transform. Forward movement is achieved by setting
            velocity every frame as opposed to transformation so there is natural interaction with ramps
            and when in the air.

                Currently movement looks very artificial in part due to a fixed camera and player. So next step is to add 
                some movement and delay to the camera when moving left and right for more dynamic visuals. Other things that will probably help
                are changing angle when in the air, changing FOV depending on velocity, etc.. Movement of the player itself can also be smoothed/delayed for less abrupt movement.
