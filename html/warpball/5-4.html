            The camera script was modified to add delay in moving to a designated place behind the player. 
            That is, the camera will not follow the player exactly as with before.
           </p>
           
           <p>
            I have used SmoothDamp before to animate 2D collectibles scattering and figured it was 
            also applicable for implementing natural camera movement. If lerp or equivalent were used I expect the camera 
            would not have a "slowdown" process and would appear choppy when side-side following stops.
           </p>

           <p>
            Below is what it looks like with camera SmoothDamp, with different paramaters for how fast the camera can move (translating to how closely it can follow the ball).

                You can still see the movement of the player itself is still choppy. This is remedied by using SmoothDamp 
                instead of transform to move the player. That is, instead of 
            </p>

            
            <pre><code>
private void FixedUpdate()
{
    // movementX is player A and D key input
    transform.Translate(new Vector3(movementX, 0 , 0) 
    * Time.deltaTime * strafeSpeed);
}
            </code></pre>

            <p>
                We have
            </p>

<pre><code>
private void FixedUpdate()
{
    // Update strafe movement based on player input
    Vector3 targetPosition = transform.position;
    targetPosition.x += movementX;    

    transform.position = 
    Vector3.SmoothDamp(transform.position, targetPosition, 
                        ref velocity, smoothTime);
}
</code></pre>

            <p>
                The results give smooth camera and player movement, making it much more natural and enjoyable to observe and play. 
            </p>
