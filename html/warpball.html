    <p> 
        Warpball is a personal coding project. The goal is to create a simple arcade game based on 
        an old mobile arcade infinite runner "Warp Rush", with a few original ideas.

        Basic prototype of the game. Temporary ramps were placed manually for testing.
        
        Strafe movement of the ball (player) is currently controlled
        directly by player input and uses direct transform. Forward movement is achieved by setting
        velocity every frame as opposed to transformation so there is natural interaction with ramps
        and when in the air.

        Currently movement looks very artificial in part due to a fixed camera and player. So next step is to add 
        some movement and delay to the camera when moving left and right for more dynamic visuals. Other things that will probably help
        are changing angle when in the air, changing FOV depending on velocity, etc.. Movement of the player itself can also be smoothed/delayed for less abrupt movement.
