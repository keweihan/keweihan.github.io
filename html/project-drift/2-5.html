                Welcome to my first blog post on my contributions to WolverineSoft Studios in Winter 2023.
                The coming posts will show what I have been up to in contributing to WSS.
                <br>
                <br>
                For the last two weeks we have determined our roles as programmers. I have been helping
                the player squad in implementing player/combat ability systems. Below are some of the
                tasks I have accomplished for this sprint.      

            <h3>
                Checkpoint System
            </h3>
                My first task was to implement a checkpoint system that allows the player to respawn
                in any given zone. It wasn't immediately clear to me how and where I would store the information, and where 
                the centralized object that stores last encountered checkpoint should be. 
                <br>
                <br>
                It took a while of reading through the suggested scripts and thinking for me to arrive on 
                a solution that I think makes the most sense based on infrastructure and conventions already
                in place in the codebase.  
                <br>
                <br>
                I used a SaveSystem that was already written allowing storage of the last checkpoint location.
                through get and set methods. This way a variable (such as a vector) can be defined to have its 
                storage be in a file on disk so its persistent across scene reloads. This variable is saved 
                as part of a new component of the player that handles death and respawning (which would respawn 
                player at its previous checkpoint). The checkpoint object itself is a prefab that has a new script 
                which renders its zone in the editor as well as the specific position it would respawn at.

                <br>
                <br>
                In trying to use this system I encountered a few issues that I have not seen before in my
                experience with Unity. One of which stemmed from a Vector3 not being serializable to the SaveSystem,
                which I figured out after using the debugger for a while. I worked around this by creating a 
                class that stores a information about a vector through floats and has a method to 
                retrieve this in the form of a vector. This allows it to be stored using the provided system
                <br>
                <br>
                Overall this was not a difficult task in itself and could've been accomplished quicker,
                but being new to the codebase I did take a while figuring out how the save system works and 
                becoming more familiar with the codebase in general.

            <h3>
                Weapons System improvements
            </h3>
                Another one of my tasks was to improve/change the weapons system backend such that it allows for 
                limiting fire rate and freezes character movement for the duration of firing a gun. I was also 
                responsible for implementing the ability to swap between weapons.
                <br>
                <br>
                This was a task where I spent a long time figuring out how best to implement it. I implemented the
                behavior successfully multiple times, but the tricky part was figuring out which was the most inline
                with the established practices of the codebase. To implement it without regards of scalability and legibility 
                was trivial; a first iteration implemented it by starting a coroutine that sets a "groundSpeed" variable controlling player
                speed to 0 for a given time.
                <br>
                <br>
                This worked, but I knew this didn't make a lot sense in a larger project as it is not clear
                when the player is in this state of not being able to walk which may be cause for future 
                confusions. After spending around two hours reading documentation and the codebase I found that the game 
                uses a statemachine pattern to define player movement behavior. Each state is implemented as 
                a "Subcontroller" which controls player movement. 
                <br>
                <br> 
                I ended up defining a new state in which the player is shooting. This is a state where the 
                player cannot move, and is arrived at when the player uses the shoot input. It also hands control back 
                after the cooldown time of the pistol passes. 
                <br>
                <br>

                </figure>
                For the weapons to be able to swap, I defined a gameObject describing the current object the player has 
                equipped, as well as a list of weapons the player can swap in addition to a SwapWeapon function. I also spent some 
                time changing existing save functionality to save this list persistently and load it from disk on start.
                This was less straighforward as there is no way to write GameObjects to disk, so strings denoting a 
                GameObject in combination with a dictionary of strings to GameObject were used instead to accomplish this.
                <br>
                <br>
                In anticipation of having to eventually display gun sprites, I changed the system to use 
                GameObjects for guns, as well as adding a display of the sprite in the form of a Gun. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The end result was I created an abstract class that contains information every gun has (ammo, fire rate, projectile etc.
                This was already defined by another programmer). This has an abstract method FireProjectiles() that 
                spawns the projectiles to fire, which should make it easy to create a new weapon by simply creating a child class and 
                implementing that function.  I also created a new player state where the player cannot move (i.e. firing their gun). 
                <br>
                <br>
                Overall, I am still getting used to the codebase, and every task was completed but took a fair amount 
                of time of thinking, iterating and reading the codebas to figure out. I think that as I get more 
                practiced with the codebase this should get better with time.

            <h3>
                Bolas/Launcher and Debuff System
            </h3>
                The weapons system changes was the bulk of the work in creating a new gun "Bolas Launcher". This new gun specified 
                by the design team has similar behavior as a pistol in that it only shoots one projectile at a time, but the key 
                part is that it should apply a slow debuff to the enemy it hits. 
                <br>
                <br>
                This necessitates a buff/debuff system which was not yet in place. Again, to implement this without regards of 
                scalability would be trivial. I started off with this approach by simply creating two components: 
                <br>
                <br>
                    1. "HasBuff" to attach to the player with a public function ApplySlowDebuff() that applies the slow debuff,
                    <br>
                    2. "SlowOnCollide" to attach to a Bolas bullet to invoke this function.
                    <br>
                    3. To create a new buff type, create a new function in HasBuff() with buff effect and corresponding timer logic. 
                    <br>
                    4. Create new buff caller component to call this function on contact.
                <br>
                <br>
                ApplySlowDebuff() would have to have its own time counter, and it would have to have logic to reverse the 
                debuff on the counter end as well as resetting its own time if ApplySlowDebuff() was called while the debuff is 
                still active.
                <br>
                <br>
                This worked fine, howeever this barebones approach would require programmers to reimplement logic that is common 
                to all buffs/debuffs: a time counter, removing the buff/defbuff on time counter. To remedy this, the following
                system was implemented: 
                <br>
                <br>
                    1. "HasBuff" to attach to the player with a public function ApplySlowDebuff(BuffSO buff) that applies a buff
                        based on the information in the BuffSO scriptable object, and automatically removes buff after it expires
                    <br>
                    2. "BuffOnCollide" to attach to a Bolas bullet to invoke this function 
                    <br>
                    3. BuffSO is an abstract class that has duration info, and defines abstract methods ActivateBuff() and DeactivateBuff()
                    <br>
                    4. Common logic between buffs/debuffs already implemented in "Hasbuff". To create a new buff, simply implement a child 
                    class to BuffSO.

                I was particularly happy about how this turned out. I found it to be good practice in thinking about and writing systems that would 
                allow for less code/logic repetition and easier implementation of new features.

                Overview
            </h3>
            Overall, tasks for me this week felt more focused on establishing infrastructure
            to allow for new features and less on the features themselves. As a result I ended up taking more 
            time to read Project Drift documentation and the code itself to understand the codebase and the programming patterns it 
            employs. My hope was to write code as legible and consistent as possible with the codebase in recognition
            that a 25 person project has higher standards with regards to code quality than I am used to with personal game projects. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I found these two weeks to have been good practice in utilizing and implementing inheritance in the 
            context of Unity (for example, learning that coroutines cannot be made directly in class instances that don't directtly inherit from Monobehavior),
            as well as getting acquainted with some of the features of C# that I have not encountered
            before (such as get and set methods). It was also a nice introduction to using ScriptableObjects and learning 
            about its uses in the process of using it to implement some of the requested features (such as a buff system).
