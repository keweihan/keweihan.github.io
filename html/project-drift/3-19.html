            <h3>
                Fixing 'C' Ability Null Reference
            </h3>
                This involved fixing an oversight in the ability system, where an 'initialize' function was written but not called properly
                by the shop when it is purchased and equipped.

                This was fixed by using a setter method that always calls initialize on change so that the fix doesn't span multiple scripts and so 
                that future bugs of the same type won't be possible.  ~ 30min

                Small Fixes 
            </h3>
                - Fixed Hammer and Spear Sprite and Behaviors. Previously not displaying correctly
                <br>
                - Fixed Gun Sprite Display. Previously displaying backwards
                <br>
                - Fixed player moving on each mosue1
                <br>
                - Fixed attack on mouse down instead of mouse up (new animations mismatch with designer specifications)

            
            <h3>
                Communicating with Design
            </h3>
            One 2hr work session with the player combat designer helped me better understand the specifics of the implementations they needed. One thing
            they needed was adjustable timing in when the sword collider shows up, which I was able to implement in the work session among other things.
            This helped me understand what was important to priortize that week.
                
            <h3>
                Sword Bullet Reflection Art Integration
            </h3>
            A quick integration of the sword reflection sprite. This was a nice learning experience in using Unity Animator to create an animated sprite.
            An easy alternative was to write a script to cycle through sprites, but I found this to be a good opportunity to learn Unity Animator through a tutorial
            to implement a simple animated art asset. One issue I encountered during this process was the recording stopping on the last frame when I wanted it disappear instead.
            I learnt that an elegant way to do this was to use the animator recording to add a new frame where the sprite is not assigned.

            The animator system is complicated and confusing but I felt that this helped acquaint me with it's very basics. 
            <h3>
                Player Charge Attack
            </h3>
            Design specified that the sword should allow the player to click and hold, then release for a different attack.

                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            This took some time to figure out as it was also dependent on the player stepping in the direction of attack during a normal attack 
            being implemented smoothly which was the majority of the task. It also required me to access the player animator through a script that was written elsewhere.

            <h3>
                Player Smooth Attack Stepping
            </h3>
            In order to implement a nice looking smooth attack, the player should have the functionality to attack step.

            Attack step before was a 1 frame teleportation in the direction of attack. I reworked the system to be smooth and adjustable by
            design using Unity AnimationCurves. It also had to be programmed in a way that is reusable by other systems (namely flurry attacks), so it had
            to be a callable function with a coroutine. 
            <br>
            <br>
            These constraints made it take a while to figure out a clean way to write it. 
            Logic was originally in the AttackController, which means each step will always be the same but it was 
            subsequently moved to the weapon as weapons may require different step lengths. It also originally used a timer variable in Update() to keep
            track of the logic for smoothly moving the player during attack, but that resulted in many public variables and hard to follow code. The cleaner method 
            that I arrived upon was to use a coroutine attached to the player, allowing for all relevant variables to be contained within the relevant IEnumerator.
            <br>
            <br>
            The reason this was not the case earlier was because the MeeleeWeaponBase class does not inherit directly from Monobehavior, disallowing use of StartCoroutine.
            This meant each couroutine must be associated with a Monobehavior object and so StartCoroutine could not be called directly. It took me some time to figure out 
            that StartCoroutine could simply be called off of an object that does inherit from the Monobehavior (such as the player). A time costly brainfart/learning moment!
