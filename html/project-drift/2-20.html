                The first of the past two weeks were dedicated to bug finding and fixing. The proceeding week 
                I was responsible for part of art integration as well as finishing implementing the sword upgrade
                attacks.
            <h3>
                Checkpoint System Bug Fixes and Additions
            </h3>
                Much of the bugs I ended up fixing were related to one of the simpler systems I implemented last sprint.
                It turns out that the actual usage of the checkpoint system introduced some unforseen problems, making the system
                slightly more complicated than originally thought.
                <br>
                <br>
                One issue was that since the Checkpoint system saves into the disk and does not differentiate between scenes. So a player
                can register a checkpoint in one scene, die in the next and be respawned at a checkpoint location that is not 
                valid for the new scene. This had to be fixed by having the checkpoint system save different location entries for each scene,
                as seen below. 
                <figure>
                    <img src="files/drift/checkpointFix.png">
                    <figcaption>
                        SceneManager.GetActiveScene() was a necessary addition for correct behavior between scenes
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>

                Another edge case was realized in issues regarding placing a checkpoint zone where the player starts by default in the scene.
                The checkpoint implementation relies on respawning the player at the previous location in a customized "LateStart()" function
                that calls one frame after the Unity function Start() is called. 
                
                This and Start() would get called every time the player dies, as death triggers a scene reload. 
                This was necessary to avoid null references to certain player variables due to accessing them too early in Start(). 
                However, this introduces the issue of giving the player a single frame of time to register itself to a checkpoint zone 
                placed at the default player location at the start of the scene. This means the player would never respawn at a checkpoint that 
                isn't the first checkpoint, rendering the system useless. 
                <br>
                <br>
                This was eventually worked around by modifying the checkpoint objects themselves to not collide or register itself with the player
                in the first few 0.5s of the scene and using OnTriggerStay() instead of OnTriggerEnter().

                <br>
                The issues don't end there. Now that the checkpoint system behaves correctly, the player will always respawn at the previous
                checkpoint encountered. This is desired in gameplay but can be inconvenient for level designers, as sometimes previous parts 
                of the level cannot be accessed on a new scene load, making it difficult to test early parts of the level. There needs to be
                a way for designers 
                <br>
                <br>
                Nikhil suggested writing a developer console command to allow teleportation between checkpoints. This fixes the issue, allowing
                designers to quickly travel between areas in a level to test their changes through gameplay. An example usage is displayed below.

                Overall this was an interesting experience with a feature that was easy to implement but has many edge cases in terms of behavior.
                It was also new to me in programming a feature that requires consideration of more than just the end player. Despite having correct 
                behavior as a checkpoint for the player, it was necessary to implement a feature to make the system easy to use for level designers
                as well which was not something I considered at first but makes sense in the end.

                    Sword Bullet Reflection
                </h3>
                One of the quicker but more visible features I implemented thus far. This was fairly straightforward to implement in terms of simply
                reversing collided bullets directories and adding some public variables to make it tunable by designers.

                <h3>
                    Level Art Integration
                </h3>
                I was asked this sprint to integrate sprite sheets into the tutorial scene. That is, import the sprite sheet, generate sprites and replace
                the tutorial scene with these new sprites. This was a learning process for me in terms of reading documentation
                and learning Unity's tiling system. I encountered many issues in this process due to being unfamiliar with the steps in using
                the system. For example, I had issues with cutting the sprites properly due to not realizing the Unity defaults the maximum resolution of
                sprite sheets to 2048x2048 sheets when the provided sheet was 3072x3072. 
                <br>
                <br>
                In the end I created a palette based on the sprite sheet. However applying the sprites themselves was a confusing process for me as
                it wasn't clear to me how the sprites were meant to be used. It is easier to explain with pictures, so below is an early iteration
                of my integration:
                <figure>
                    <img src="files/drift/NotTopDown.PNG">
                    <figcaption>
                        Something off...
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
                It is evident that there is something off. It seems like a top down view whereas the game is meant to be somewhat isometric.
                The edge wall sprites also definitely don't seem like they're being used according to the artists intent. After consulting with
                an artist I managed to implement a better looking version (I hope) of the integrated art.
                <figure>
                    <img src="files/drift/caveTiled.PNG">
                    <figcaption>
                        Better - use empty tiles.
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
                It is still a work in progress and a lot more working with the actual Unity editor than I am used to. Though I feel that I now
                understand a bit more about Unity and the various tools it has in tilemaps and tile palettes.
