            <h3>
                Fixing 'C' Ability Null Reference
            </h3>
                This involved fixing an oversight in the ability system, where an 'initialize' function was written but not called properly
                by the shop when it is purchased and equipped.

                This was fixed by using a setter method that always calls initialize on change. ~ 30min

            Design specified a that the sword should allow the player to click and hold, then release for a different attack.

            This took some time to figure out as it was also dependent on the player stepping in the direction of attack during a normal attack 
            being implemented smoothly which was the majority of the task.

                Player Smooth Attack Stepping
            </h3>
            In order to implement a nice looking smooth attack, the player should have the functionality to attack step.

            Attack step before was a 1 frame teleportation in the direction of attack. I reworked the system to be smooth and adjustable by
            design using Unity AnimationCurves, as programmed in a way that is reusable by other systems (namely flurry attacks). This took 
            a while to figure out. Logic was originally in the AttackController, which means each step will always be the same but it was 
            subsequently moved to the weapon as weapons may require different step lengths.
